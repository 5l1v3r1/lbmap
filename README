OWASP AppSecAsia 2012. These scripts should be considered a PoC or alpha quality. 
Suggestions, recommendations, signatures, pathces and flames are welcome via 
http://www.github.com/wireghoul/lbmap.

The following tools are included:

LBMAP (and LBMAP2)
------------------
lbmap is a fingerprinting tool aimed at detecting load balancers, reverse proxies, 
web application firewalls and other web agents residing in front of web servers.

USAGE
lbmap [options] url

OPTIONS
--debug
--timeout
--version

lbmap is the early version of the PoC and tries to use individual requests to 
fingerprint. lbmap2 is the improved version with support for passive detection, 
signature based fingerprint and more. The tool currently dumps debugging output 
of the fingerprinting process until a presentation format is decided.

APROF
-----
aprof is a fingerprinting tool capable of remotely detecting which modules an 
Apache server has loaded.
